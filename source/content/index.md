I’m EJ Mason. I’m a software engineer, web accessibility specialist, writer, and speaker. This website is a work-in-progress. Enjoy whatever you find here!

Currently, I'm doing front-end stuff at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and I also volunteer with [The A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) and [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes). If you want to say hi, you can [find me on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/codeability) or [email me](mailto:hey@ejmason.com)!
